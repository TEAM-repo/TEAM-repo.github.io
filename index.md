# Welcome!

[This website and repository](https://github.com/TEAM-repo/TEAM-repo.github.io) were first unveiled at SIGCSE 2019 as part of the paper 
["Redesigning a Software Development Course as a Preparation for a Capstone: An Experience Report"](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3287498).

### Abstract
Students need a wide variety of skills before they can successfully engage in real-world
projects with paying customers. Some of these skills, such as the "soft skills" of
communicating with a non-technical customer and working in a larger team to collaboratively
develop a project, are generally not present in Computer Science courses. In this
paper, we discuss our experience teaching these skills and explain the structure of
our redesigned Software Development course and how it aligns with the Capstone experience.
The main novelty of our approach is the specific implementation of the rotating project
manager role and the introduction of the final portfolio reflection. We believe that
the concepts we introduced during our redesign can be useful to any educator wanting
to include collaborative project-based work in their courses. To enable faculty to
apply and enhance these concepts, the resources that we used in this course, which
include activities, templates, guidelines, rubrics, and questionnaires, are available
as an open source project at https://team-repo.github.io.

## Updates

* In Jan 2020, Claremont McKenna College (CMC) invited Dr. Kharitonova to use these TEAM-repo materials as part of a day-long capstone preparation workshop for their teams.
* In Nov 2020, Dr. Kharitonova used these TEAM-repo materials to create a quick guide to the [Capstone Resources](https://team-repo.github.io/ucsb-2020-capstone) to provide UCSB Data Science teams with a starting point for collaborative work.
* In Sep 2021, these materials were used at UCSB as part of the [UCSB Data Science Capstone Preparation Workshop](https://ucsb-ds.github.io/workshop2021/).

Did you use these materials? Do you have any updates? Feel free to let us know by [editing this page](https://github.com/TEAM-repo/TEAM-repo.github.io/edit/master/index.md) and submitting a Pull Request.
