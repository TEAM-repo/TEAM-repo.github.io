# Welcome!

This repository was first unveiled at SIGCSE 2019 as part of our paper 
["Redesigning a Software Development Course as a Preparation for a Capstone: An Experience Report"](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3287498).

These 
Teaching 
Experiential 
Action-based 
Materials
(TEAM) 
    are intended for instructors who are teaching team-based project courses.

## Team Retrospectives (aka Phase Reflections)

[team_eval.md]({{site.materials_repo}}team_eval.md) and [postmortem.md]({{site.materials_repo}}postmortem.md) from the "Team Retrospectives (aka Phase Reflections)" category can also be listed under the "Individual Assignments" category, since they are completed by each student.

| Page | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------|--------|
| [Phase 1](phase_reflection_1.md) and [Phase 2-3](phase_reflection_2and3.md) | Each phase of the project brings a slightly different focus (and thus format) to the reflection. Contains both, the individual and team component. |
| [team_eval.md]({{site.materials_repo}}team_eval.md) | Each student submits a "Final team eval spreadsheet" evaluating themselves and their teammates. |
| [postmortem.md]({{site.materials_repo}}postmortem.md) | A set of final reflection questions, aka Postmortem |


## Project Manager (PM) Assignments

| Page | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------|--------|
| [pm_expectations.md]({{site.materials_repo}}pm_expectations.md) | PM's primary responsibilities and expectations |
| [project_report.md]({{site.materials_repo}}project_report.md) |  A report submitted by the PM at the end of each week.|
| [presentation.md]({{site.materials_repo}}presentation.md) | Project Manager Presentation occures at the end of each phase (or the beginning of the next phase, recapping the previous phase). Each phase has a different focus. **Needs formatting**  |
| [presentation_reflection.md]({{site.materials_repo}}presentation_reflection.md) | A short self-reflection and presentation assessment by the PM. Submitted before they see the video of their presentation. The Postmortem comes back to this reflection, asking them about their presentation, now that they've seen the video (potentially, after several weeks have passed, unless it's the last PM) |



## Individual Assignments

[team_eval.md]({{site.materials_repo}}team_eval.md) and [postmortem.md]({{site.materials_repo}}postmortem.md) from the "Team Retrospectives (aka Phase Reflections)" category can also be listed under the "Individual Assignments" category, since they are completed by each student.
